llvm-examples
=============

The repo is to keep some examples of the LLVM.
Some of them are moved from llvm/examples, and others are writen by myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1:
ModuleMaker
-----------
This example is moved from the llvm3.5 release version. I just wrote a make file
for it, let it can be run on the outside of the llvm.
Before you run this example, you must make sure you have install llvm on your
computer. If you use the source code to install llvm, please don't forget to use
the command "make install" after you build llvm.
I also add a dump version of this example on the branch: ModuleMaker_dump. The
dump version can direct dump the IR to the std out.
